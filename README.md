# Sada Mia Hosting Panel

A lightweight, self-hosted server management panel designed for Ubuntu Linux. This panel allows you to easily deploy and manage Next.js, Laravel, and Static HTML applications on a single server without using Docker. It provisions apps natively using PM2 for Node.js and PHP-FPM for Laravel.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📦 Application Management

- **Native Deployment:** Apps run directly on the host OS for maximum performance and lowest RAM overhead.
- **Framework Support:** Optimized for **Next.js** (PM2), **Laravel** (PHP 8.4 + FPM), and **Static Sites**.
- **Automated Pipeline:** Automatic Git integration, dependency installation (`npm`/`composer`), build execution, and Nginx reload.
- **Lifecycle Control:** Simplified **Running** and **Stopped** status indicators with full start/stop/restart/deploy controls.
- **Background Workers:** Manage application-specific background services (e.g., Laravel Queue Workers) via systemd.
- **Environment Management:** Web-based `.env` file editor for seamless configuration.
- **Real-time Logs:** Dedicated streaming log viewers for application, Nginx error, and access logs.

### 🌐 Infrastructure & Networking

- **Load Balancing:** Built-in Nginx load balancers with support for **Round Robin**, **Least Connections**, and **IP Hash** algorithms.
- **DNS Management:** Full-featured **BIND9 integration** for managing domains, subdomains, and records (A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, TXT, NS, SRV, CAA).
- **SSL / TLS:** Automated **Certbot (Let's Encrypt)** integration for all apps and load balancers. Supports Force HTTPS and securing the panel itself.
- **Database Management:** One-click **PostgreSQL** database and user provisioning with granular permission and global privilege management.
- **Email Service:** Complete **Postfix/Dovecot** suite for managing email domains, accounts, and aliases directly from the panel.

### 💼 CRM & Monetization

- **Customer CRM:** Comprehensive client tracking for leads and active subscribers with linked resource management.
- **Subscription Engine:** Advanced subscription management with support for **Flat Rate** and **Credit-based** plans.
- **Integrated Payments:** Ready-to-use payment gateway integrations for **bKash**, **Nagad**, and **SSLCommerz**.
- **Metered Billing:** Track and bill usage for specific API routes (**Billable Routes**) with detailed access logs.
- **Client Portal:** A dedicated public portal for customers to manage their own subscriptions and payments.
- **Automatic Gating:** Instant Nginx-level blocking for expired accounts with a professional "Expired Notice" landing page.

### 🛠️ Developer Tools & Security

- **Web Terminal:** Integrated browser-based shell access for quick server commands.
- **File Manager:** Full-featured web interface for file operations (upload, download, rename, chmod, compress/extract).
- **Queue Monitor:** Visual tracking for Laravel queue health, including ready, delayed, and failed job counts.
- **Cron Management:** Easy-to-use UI for managing system-level cron jobs and viewing execution logs.
- **Server Health:** Live dashboard for monitoring CPU, RAM, Disk usage, and active system processes.
- **GitHub Integration:** Seamless OAuth connection with support for **Auto-Deploy on Push** via webhooks.

## ⌨️ Artisan CLI Reference

The panel includes several custom Artisan commands for system orchestration and maintenance:

| Command                              | Description                                                                            |
| :----------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `php artisan app:nginx-sync`         | Regenerates Nginx configuration files for all applications using current stubs.        |
| `php artisan app:nginx-ssl-sync`     | Regenerates Nginx SSL configurations for all apps and load balancers.                  |
| `php artisan app:ssl-renew`          | Renews all Let's Encrypt certificates and syncs status (Runs **Daily** via Scheduler). |
| `php artisan app:panel-ssl {domain}` | Secures the hosting panel (port 8083) using an existing domain's certificate.          |
| `php artisan cron:run {id}`          | Force-runs a specific UI-managed cron job and captures its output.                     |

## 📥 Installation

The panel comes with a one-click automated bash script designed to be run on a fresh **Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04** server.

### Prerequisites

- A fresh Ubuntu Server instance.
- Root or `sudo` access via SSH.

### 1. Download the repository

SSH into your server and clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sada-mia-hosting-panel.git
cd sada-mia-hosting-panel
```

### 2. Configure Environment (Optional)

The installer will automatically generate an `.env` file in the root directory if one doesn't exist. You can pre-create this file to customize the installation behavior:

```env
# panel root .env
APP_ENV=production    # Use "local" to bind to the LAN IP automatically
PANEL_PORT=8083       # Default Nginx port
PANEL_IP=             # Explicit IP to bind to
```

### 3. Run the Installer

Run the installation script. By default, it will auto-detect your server's public IP and run on port `8083`.
_ (If you set `APP_ENV=local` in the `.env` file, it will automatically use your local network IP instead of fetching your public IP)._

```bash
chmod +x install.sh

# Option A: Auto-detect public IP and use default port (8083)
sudo ./install.sh

# Option B: Specify IP, use default port (8083)
sudo ./install.sh 192.168.1.100

# Option C: Specify IP and custom port
sudo ./install.sh 192.168.1.100 8080

# Option D: Run with Data Cleanup (Keeps tools, resets apps/data)
sudo ./install.sh --cleanup
```

### 💡 Data Cleanup Mode

Using the `--cleanup` flag allows you to reset the panel without reinstalling foundational software (PHP, Nginx, etc.).
**What gets cleaned up:**

- All deployed apps in `/var/www/hosting-apps/`
- Nginx site configurations, BIND9 zone files, and Postfix data.
- The panel database (reset to original seeded state).

### 3. Log In

Once finished, go to `http://<YOUR_SERVER_IP>:<YOUR_PORT>` in your browser.

- **Default Email:** `admin@panel.local`
- **Default Password:** `admin`
  _(Change these in the Settings tab immediately after logging in)._

---

## 🐙 GitHub Integration

1. **OAuth App:** Register a new OAuth app in GitHub Settings with the callback: `http://<IP>:<PORT>/github/callback`.
2. **Setup:** Enter your Client ID, Secret, and a Webhook Secret in the panel's **Settings** tab.
3. **Connect:** Click "Connect GitHub" and you're ready to pick repositories and enable **Auto-Deploy on Push**!

---

## 💻 Local Development

```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

Concurrently boots the **Laravel API** (8000) and **Vite React** (5173) server.
_(Note: System operations like Nginx/PM2 require a native Ubuntu environment)._
